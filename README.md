A simple portfolio page to showcase my work as a Software Engineer, links to my socials, and a contact form to get in touch with me. The page is built using Next 13+ and takes advantage of new features like react server components, image/link optimization, and more. The page is styled using TailwindCSS and is [deployed on Netlify](https://jonahwagner.com).
