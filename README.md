## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Next, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Vercel

I set out to create a simple, clean, and blazingly fast portfolio in order to showcase my abilities as a web developer. For these goals, Next.js + Vercel was the perfect solution, allowing me to create a statically generated site with extremely fast response times. With a combination of Server Components and Server Actions, nearly all of the site is able to be rendered on the server side, including a working contact form for potential clients/employers to get in touch. Utilizing TailwindCSS I was able to create a modern and responsive design, without spending a lot of time writing endless media queries. Typescript was a great addition to the project, providing type safety and allowing me to catch errors before they happened.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was a great opportunity to learn more about Next.js and TailwindCSS. I was able to dive deep into the documentation and learn about some of the more advanced features of Next.js, such as Server Components and Server Actions. The portfolio has also provided a simple and safe area for me to experiment with bleeding edge features to learn how they could be used in my work to create better products.
